Trend Analysis

The code in the attached Jupyter Notebook analysed data for the game, Heroes of Pymoli. This analysis consisted of finding the total number of players and a purchasing analysis. The purchasing analysis was further investigated based upon gender and age demographics. Top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items were also identified. Below are three trend observations from this dataset.

Of the total 576 players, the majority of the player population was male, at 84.03%.

The peak age range was 20-24 years old, 44.79% of the player population. The Age Demographics section data table suggests a positive skewness in distribtion of age ranges.

The top selling item was the Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm - at 12 purchases.
